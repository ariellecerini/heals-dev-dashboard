## Mac Users 

If you are using an Apple computer, you will need to install Node Version Manager before installing the application dependencies. 
For instructions on how to install nvm using Homebrew [click here](https://github.com/semantics-for-personal-health/heals-dev-dashboard.git).


Once you have nvm installed, via terminal, navigate into your cloned git repository. Enter the following command.

```bash
nvm install 14.17.0
```

After installing the proper Node version, you can go ahead and install the application dependencies and run the application. 

### Please note: You will need to switch your node version everytime you open a new terminal window. If you do not you will likely receive errors about incompatible dependencies.
